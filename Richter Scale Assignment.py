#Python Richter Scale Calculation
#Your first and last name:Robert Hart
#Your ID:s1197899

#Requirements Version 1:
# ask the user to 'Enter the Richter scale value: '
#   hint1: use an 'input' statement to input a variable called 'richter'
#   hint2: make sure 'richter' is a 'floating point' by using 'float'
# make sure richter scale value is greater than 0
#   if not, print "Value must be greater than 0"
# determine the Effect for the Richter scale value entered
#   hint1: use 'if' 'elif' and 'else' statements
#   hint2: remember to use ':' following all 'if' 'elif' and 'else' statements
#Â display or print the Effect
#   hint: use 'print' statement (only 1 effect should print)
# ask the user if they want to enter another richter scale value
#   if not, end the program

#Additional Requirements Version 2:
# ask the user to 'Enter the Richter scale value or -99 to end: '
#   if richter = -99, end the program

# make sure richter scale value is greater than 0
#   if not, print "Value must be greater than 0"
#   and make them enter another value


# Test your program several times with the following values:
#   8.1, 8.0, 7.1, 7.0, 6.1, 6.0, 4.6, 4.5, 4,4, -4.6

game = True
while game:
    richter=float(input('Enter the richter scale value: '))
    if richter ==-99:
        game= False
        continue
    if richter >= 8.0:
        print('most stuctures fall')
    elif richter >= 7.0:
        print('Many buildings destroyed')
    elif richter >= 6.0:
        print('Many building considerably damaged, some collapse')
    elif richter >=4.5:
        print('Damage to poorly constructed buildings')
    elif richter > 0:
        print('No destruction of buildings')
    else:
         print('Value must be greater than 0')
